## Week 8
Breadboard milestone was due in this week (see picture below). <br>
Moreover, we had to check if everything is on track or not.
After meeting with my team member and checking the work done so far, I can say me and my team member are going as planned and we are meeting the goal set. Unfortunately I received my sensor late which left me behind with the soldering. However, I had already watched tutorial and practiced in class. 
So thanks to Vlad and Kelly I was able to catch up quickly.

Before doing the breadboarding I prepared a fritzing diagram:<br>

Pseudo-code was also written to get an idea of what code we will have to write for the power up
