#### Max3010Sensor
This file contains data for a project involving the Max3010x sensor
## Week 10
This week was due the PCB soldering. As advised by our teacher I moved to create a modular PCB using header. So as mentioned in the previous week I reached out Kelly from the prototype lab for the headers and he provided me the headers. However, they did not have the 6x2 and 5x1 pin header so they gave me a bigger one and I cut those to fit my requirements. My [budget](https://github.com/gsmann997/Max3010Sensor/documents/budget.xlsx)  did not see major changes thanks to the help of the prototype lab.
So the final result is:

Then I tested the PCB using the i2c detect command as we did with the breadbording milestone.

Next week is the power up milestone for which we have to push or pull data to the sensor. For this milestone I am actually behind one week on based on my [schedule]( https://github.com/gsmann997/Max3010Sensor/blob/master/documents/schedule.pdf) as a partial solution of this I am going to condensate all the hour I planned to put for this part of the project in one week and be ready for next week milestion. Even though I was able to ask the teacher a question I was concerned about the implementation of the software. In fact there are no library available for the integration of the MAX30105 with the raspberry pi, so the professor advised me to implement the code for the sensor starting from being able to pull the raw data from the sensor.
 ## Week 9
PCB designed and submitted Geber of the designed PCB to the prototype lab for printing.
During the design of the PCB I spent a lot of time while trying to find a compatible connector/sensor that will have the same pins as the one I am using. However I was not sure about the distance between pins so with more research I was actually able to find my sensors fritzing part online. <br><br>

# Progress Report:
So far everything is going as planned, even though I spent more time than what was necessary on the designing of the PCB, and I am behind schedule on the software part of the project (get readings from the sensor).<br>
This week I am going to try to catch on the schedule and go to the prototype lab to ask for help on the software part.<br>
My budget may see some changment with some extra cost due the fact that I am going to use two stackable headers: one of 6 pin and one of 5 pin to be able to get more modularity and versatility on my project, so even if my PCB will not work I will be able to design and use another one faster.
For this extra cost I have to see Vlad and Kelly from the prototype lab as they might have extra headers in the lab.
## Week 8
Breadboard milestone was due in this week (see picture below). <br>
Moreover, we had to check if everything is on track or not.
After meeting with my team member and checking the work done so far, I can say me and my team member are going as planned and we are meeting the goal set. Unfortunately I received my sensor late which left me behind with the soldering. However, I had already watched tutorial and practiced in class. 
So thanks to Vlad and Kelly I was able to catch up quickly.
So far no extra cost was required.

Before doing the breadboarding I prepared a fritzing diagram (my sensor was not available in fritzing so I used another sensor with the same Pin):<br>

## Week 7
This week we did the soldering.

Pseudo-code was also written to get an idea of what code we will have to write for the power up

### Week 2
This week I meet up with my group member and prepared the proposal.
